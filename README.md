# Customer-Churn-Prediction
This repository contains a **Customer Churn Prediction** model built using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer is likely to leave (churn) based on various factors, such as customer demographics, usage patterns, and subscription information.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a major concern for companies, particularly in industries like telecom, banking, and e-commerce. By predicting which customers are at risk of leaving, businesses can take proactive measures to retain them, improving overall customer retention and reducing costs associated with acquiring new customers.

In this project, we use historical customer data to train a machine learning model to predict churn. The dataset includes various features such as customer demographics, account information, and usage statistics.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and model building.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used to train and evaluate the model.
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn**: Visualization libraries used for data exploration and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment for experimentation and exploration.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a customer churn dataset, which can be found [here](insert_link_to_dataset). The data contains the following key features:

- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Gender**: Customer's gender.
- **Age**: Customer's age.
- **AccountLength**: Duration of the customerâ€™s relationship with the company.
- **Churn**: Target variable indicating if the customer has churned (1) or not (0).
- **MonthlySpend**: Monthly spending on the service.
- **ContractType**: Type of subscription contract (e.g., month-to-month, one year, two years).
- **ServiceUsage**: Metrics indicating how often the customer uses the service.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction.git

## Usage
Launch Jupyter Notebook or your preferred IDE.
Open the notebook customer_churn_prediction.ipynb.
Run the cells step by step to explore the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Steps in the Notebook:
Data Exploration: Analyzing the dataset, cleaning missing values, and feature engineering.
Model Training: Training several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.
Churn Prediction: Generating predictions for new customer data.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the models is evaluated using several metrics:

Accuracy: Proportion of correct predictions.
Precision: How many predicted churns were actually churns.
Recall: How many actual churns were correctly identified.
F1-Score: A balance between precision and recall.
ROC-AUC: The area under the ROC curve, showing the tradeoff between true positive rate and false positive rate.
