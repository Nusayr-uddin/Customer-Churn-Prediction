# Customer-Churn-Prediction
This repository contains a **Customer Churn Prediction** model built using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer is likely to leave (churn) based on various factors, such as customer demographics, usage patterns, and subscription information.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a major concern for companies, particularly in industries like telecom, banking, and e-commerce. By predicting which customers are at risk of leaving, businesses can take proactive measures to retain them, improving overall customer retention and reducing costs associated with acquiring new customers.

In this project, we use historical customer data to train a machine learning model to predict churn. The dataset includes various features such as customer demographics, account information, and usage statistics.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and model building.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used to train and evaluate the model.
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn**: Visualization libraries used for data exploration and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment for experimentation and exploration.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a customer churn dataset, which can be found [here](insert_link_to_dataset). The data contains the following key features:

- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Gender**: Customer's gender.
- **Age**: Customer's age.
- **AccountLength**: Duration of the customerâ€™s relationship with the company.
- **Churn**: Target variable indicating if the customer has churned (1) or not (0).
- **MonthlySpend**: Monthly spending on the service.
- **ContractType**: Type of subscription contract (e.g., month-to-month, one year, two years).
- **ServiceUsage**: Metrics indicating how often the customer uses the service.
